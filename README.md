# Dynamic-Classification-Using-Kafka
An ML model is trained on a static dataset in the static model notebook. The trained model is then saved as a pickle file and used in a simulated dynamic environment in which single inputs are received from a kafka server and the model is used to make predictions in real-world like scenario. \
Please see the PDF report for a detailed explanation on the whole program.
